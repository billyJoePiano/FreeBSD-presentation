# Student Presentation Topic Will Go Here

### Presentation Description/Overview

I will be presenting about a development/web server using FreeBSD (a Unix OS similair to Linux but also somewhat different).  The server includes some public-facing services, as well as a number of services only available to me
(SSH and SMB file-sharing) and/or to people on my local network (some beta apps).

I would also like to demonstrate the security aspects of this -- firewall & access-control policies, FreeBSD "jails" (similair to docker containers,
but implemented at the kernel-level), and other security considerations.
